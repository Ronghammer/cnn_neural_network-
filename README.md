Business-Analyst Related Job Posting Content Classification Using Supervised Learning Methods and Descriptive Analysis of the US market

With the rising trend of online job postings, requirements and job titles obtained from those are an essential source for text classification. One answer could be to improve title matching efficiency in the context of imbalanced dataset. This paper addresses text classification effectiveness of imbalanced dataset using supervised learning models. In this paper, six main supervised machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB), Gradient Boosting, AdaBoost, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) have been considered for multi-classification of job descriptions. The experiment was conducted on the dataset of Glassdoor and provided a comprehensive comparison of several popular classifiers. The accuracy of these models is critically examined in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1. Additionally, this paper provides a descriptive analysis of the current Business-Analysts related job market in the United States: an overview of the market and presents differences among six job classes including skill and other discriminative terms. To help organization website developer update their text classifiers, I enclose the link for model implementation and provide recommendations about model based on experimental results.
